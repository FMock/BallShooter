\section*{Description}
This game is coded in Python and currently consists of a single source file named ballshooter.py. The player earns points by shooting a red ball that bounces around the window. To make the game more challenging, additional random shapes will appear in the window. The red ball will bounce off the additional shapes. It the player accidentally shoots a shape that is not the red ball the game is over. As the game progresses more additional shapes will appear and the red ball will move faster.
\section*{Game Controls}
Left Arrow - moves shooter left\\
Right Arrow - moves shooter right\\
Up Arrow - fires a bullet\\
Down Arrow - stops the shooter from moving\\
\section*{Bugs}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item If you fire a bullet before the previous bullet leaves the game window then the previous window will stop moving and remain in the game window for the duration of the game.
\end{enumerate}
\section*{To Do}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Fix the bug where a bullet will stay on the screen if a bullet is fired before the previous one has left the game window
 \item Show the players score in the game window
 \item Add additional random shapes periodically to the game window
 \item Add a sound effect that sounds each time the ball is shot 
 \end{enumerate}
